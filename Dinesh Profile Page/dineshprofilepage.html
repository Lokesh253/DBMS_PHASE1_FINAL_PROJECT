                    <p>I hail from Steel Plant Township, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. I completed my schooking from "Delhi Public School, Ukkunagaram" in my city. Later, I went on to complete my Intermediate education from "Sri Venkateswara Junior College, Seethamadhara" which is also in the city. After clearing the JEE Main examination, I secured my seat in IIITDM Kancheepuram in ECE department initially. Upon seecuring a good CGPA in my 1st semester, I got branch transfered to CSE department, where I'm currently studying in for my 4th semester. </p>

                    <p>I'm very much like a novice myself in this Computer Science world. If we talk about my non-technical skills, I'm a good communicator. I pitch my ideas, thoughts and suggestions in such a way that others get the overall picture in one shot. Also, I'm a good team player and actively participate in GD's, taking my team mates' suggestions and work collectively as a team. If we talk about technical skills, I'm a competitive programmer & therby I possess decent problem solving skills. Apart from this, I'm also interested in making websites(particularly frontend as of now) which look cool and eye-catching. As a CSE student, I know a few languages like C, C++, Python, HTML&CSS.</p>

                    <p>Well... my interests include playing outdoor sports like Cricket, Football, Basketball, etc. I'm a crazy fan of Football and my favourite football club is "Chelsea F.C" who are currently the European Champions. I also love listening to music (mostly pop & party songs) in my free time to escape out of academic life & watch a lot of action movies. I recently (3 months ago) picked up this craze of "Competitive Programming" which I later got to know, has its own benefits. I like solving challenging problems which will prepare me for my future.</p>
